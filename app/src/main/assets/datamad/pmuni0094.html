<h3>HYMN  1   (civapurANam) <br>
Civan's way of Old   (or)<br>
Civan's Course from Everlasting</h3>
<br>
This has always been considered the first of MAnikka-vACagar's poems, and it 
has all the characteristics of a preface, as enumerated in the NannUl; but its very 
technical completeness makes its genuineness doubtful; and it rather apperars to have 
been added by the Tillai assembly when the lyrics of the Saint were first collected.  
In the VAthavUrar purANam(V II) it is said that after the divine Master had returned 
to Kailacam, the sage with the 999 devotees remained under the Kurunthu tree at 
Perunn-turrai, where the God had first appeared to him; erected a shrine there, and 
spent this time in adoration and praise, until his fellow-worshippers passed through 
the fire to Civan, leaving him alone. To this, the first period of his religious history, 
the following three poems belong; and also according to tradition, lyrics 19, 20, 23-29, 
32-34, 36, 38, 39, 41-48, and perhaps a few others.<br>
Here all the Tamil lines are of four feet, except the last, which has three only. 
The connection is VeNTaLai. The metre is veng-kalipA.<br>

<br>
SALUTATIONS<br>

<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Because He, Civan, within my thought abides,<br>
By His grace alone, bowing before His feet,<br>
With joyous thought, Civan's 'Ways of Old' I'll tell,<br>
That thus my former 'deeds' may wholly pass.                               (20)<br>
<br>
I came, attained the grace the 'Brow-eyed' showed,<br>
Adored the beauteous foot by thought unreached.<br>
O Thou, Who fill'st the heaven, Who fill'st the earth, art manifested light,<br>
Transcending thought, Thou boundless One ! Thy glory great<br>
I, man of evil 'deeds' know not the way to praise !                         (25)<br>
<br>
HIS VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS<br>
Grass was I, shrub was I, worm, tree,<br>
Full many a kind of beast, bird, snake,<br>
Stone, man, and demon. 'Midst Thy hosts I served.<br>
The form of mighty Asuras, ascetics, gods I bore.<br>
Within these immobile and mobile forms of life,                            (30)<br>
In every species born, weary I've grown, great Lord !<br>
<br>
HE FOUND THE MASTER<br>
Truly, seeing Thy golden feet this day, I've gained release.<br>
O Truth! as the OngAram dwelling in my soul, <br>
That I may 'scape. O spotless one ! O Master of the bull !<br>
Lord of the VEdas! Rising, sinking, spreading, subtile One !               (35)<br>
Thou art the heat ! and Thou the cold ! the Master Thou, O spotless One !<br>
Thou cam'st in grace, that all things false might flee,<br>
True Wisdom, gleaming bright in splendour true,<br>
To me, void of all wisdom, blissful Lord !<br>
O Wisdom fair, causing unwisdom' self to flee far off !                    (40)<br>
<br>
CIVAN'S FIVE OPERATIONS<br>
Thou know'st no increase, measure, end ! All worlds<br>
Thou dost create, protect, destroy, enrich with grace,<br>
Release. Thou causest me to enter 'mid Thy servant band.<br>
More subtile Thou than fragrance. Thou'art afar, art near.<br>
Thou art the Mystic word, transcending word and thought.                   (45)<br>
As when are mingled milk, sweet juice of cane and butter,<br>
Thou dost distil, like honey, in the thought of glorious devotees,<br>
And cuttest off the continuity of births - our mighty One !<br>
<br>
HUMAN EMBODIMENT AND ENLIGHTENMENT BY GRACE<br>
Thou hast the colours five ! While heavenly ones extolled<br>
Thou didst lie hid, our mighty Lord ! In the strong grasp of deeds,        (50)<br>
I lay, hidden amid illusion's shrouding gloom.<br>
Thou binding with rare cords of virtue and of sin,<br>
Didst clothe with outer skin, enveloping with worms and filth, -<br>
Within my nine-gated dwelling foul bewildered,<br>
By the five senses sore deceived, -                                         (55)<br>
To me, mean as I was, with no good thing, Thou didst grant grace,<br>
That I, with mind erewhile embruted, - pure one ! - should<br>
Become commingling love, in soul-subduing rapture melt !<br>
Thou cam'st in grace on this same earth, didst show Thy mighty feet<br>
To me who lay mere slave, - meaner than any dog, -                          (60)<br>
Essential grace more precious than a mother's love !<br>
<br>
EPITHETS OF PRAISE<br>
Spotless splendour ! Brightness of full-blown flower !<br>
O Teacher ! Honied ambrosia ! Lord of Civa-town !<br>
O venerated One, Guardian, Looser of PAcam's tie,<br>
Working in grace of love, that in my mind delultion may die out !           (65)<br>
Great river of exceeding tenderness, with ceaseless flow !<br>
Ambrosia that satiates not ! Infinite, almighty Lord !<br>
Light unseen that lurks within the souls that sought Thee not !<br>
Thou Who abidest in my soul, till melting waters flow !<br>
Thou Who art without pleasure or pain, Who yet hast both !                  (70)<br>
Loving to loving ones ! Effulgent One, Who all things art, <br>
And their negation too ! Great Master, whom no darkness gathers round !<br>
First One, Thou'rt End and Midst, and art devoid of these !<br>
Father, Lord, Who drew'st, and mad'st me Thine !<br>
Eye of the minds that see by keenest glance of wisdom true,                 (75)<br>
Hard to be eyed !  Subtle understanding, none can scrutinize !<br>
Holy ! Who comest not, nor goest, nor mingling liv'st !<br>
Guardian who guardest us ! Great Light whom none can see !<br>
Flood of delight ! Father ! Light of all passing splendours<br>
That appear ! Unutterably subtle Intellect !                                (80)<br>
Of all that in this world diverse pronounced as truth<br>
Is known, Thou art the knowledge sure ! Full certitude !<br>
Precious ambrosia, fountain welling up within ! My Owner Thou !<br>
<br>
PASSIONATE INVOCATION<br>
I can't endure, our Guru, in this changing straitened frame to 'bide.<br>
Aran! All Thy saints made true invoke Thee,                                (85)<br>
Worshipping abide, and praising Thee, from falsehood freed,<br>
Hither return no more ! That deeds and birth cling not,<br>
To sever bonds of this deceitful sensuous frame the might is Thine !<br>
Lord who dost dance, trampling dense darkness down !<br>
Dancer in Thillai ! Dweller in the Southern PAndi land !                   (90)<br>
Thou Who dost cut off evil birth ! - Adoring ever, Thee they name,<br>
Whom words declare not; then 'NEATH THY SACRED FEET<br>
THEY LEARN THE MEANING OF THEIR SONG. The blessed ones<br>
In Civan's town who dwell, - full many a one, - beneath<br>
The feet of Civan, lowly bending utter praise.                 (95)<br>

HYMN II . kIrttit tiru akaval<br>
CIVAN'S FAME<br>
THE SACRED SONG OF CIVAN'S RENOWNED ACTS</h3>
(composed in Tillai, tiru vAtavUrar purANam, v. 62)
<p>

The sacred foot that danced in Tillai's city old<br>
Is His, Who in all varied lives has energized;<br>
Revealed in beauty of innumerous, varied qualities; <br>
In earth, in sky, and in celestial worlds.<br>
All ordered lore hath He revealed, and He made void.                      (5)<br>
My darkness hath He driven for aye far off.<br>
Within His servants' inmost soul that love o'erflows<br>
He dwells, - His glory and His choice.<br>
On great MahEndra's biding hill<br>
In grace He caused the uttered Agamas appear.                            (10)<br>
He came with the good goddess,<br>
Pleasant and gracious, mingling with men at KallAdam.<br>
With her whose words are milk in the 'fivefold couch,'<br>
He caused sweet grace, that unfailing accumulates, to grow.<br>
In guise of a woodman, of her whose lips are crimson,                    (15)<br>
He sank in the lovely expanse of the swelling breast.<br>
Becoming a fisherman He caught the shark.<br>
And he received the Agamas, a rich spoil.<br>
Moreover, on MahEndra seated, the self-same Agamas<br>
From His five mouths He graciously spake forth.                          (20)<br>
In our abode a BrAhman He became,<br>
And as a deathless Guru dwelt in grace.<br>
Assuming diverse forms, and diverse habitudes,<br>
As hundreds of hundreds of thousands of natures,<br>
I Can, Lord of the bull, that the world might be saved, -                 (25) <br>
He and the Lady, His partner, - came in grace.<br>
Bringing horses, in the Western land,<br>
Right royally He rode in state.<br>
In fair PuttUr, town of the dart, upon the bull He rode, <br>
Made manifest His state and glorious pomp.                               (30)<br>
In a mirror, at PuttUr of the santhal-wood,<br>
Gave increase to the woodman armed with bow.<br>
His form all flame, that held the 'gram-bag',<br>
In magic beauty exquisite, of old he showed.<br>
He whose extent to Hari and to BrahmA was not known,                      (35)<br>
In goodness jackals into horse made,<br>
To make him His, He of the sacred foot,<br>
The chargers to the PAndiyan sold,<br>
Nor deigned to take the heaped-up gold.<br>
Our King made me His slave, and in the path of grace to keep,             (40)<br>
Made manifest the ancient brightening ray.<br>
Becoming a BrAhman, graciously making me His own,<br>
He showed the magic illusion.<br>
Coming to Madura, the city great and fair,<br>
He became a horse's groom.                                                 (45)<br>
And therein too, for the female devotee<br>
He condescended to carry earth.<br>
In Uttara-KOca-Mangai abiding<br>
He showed His special form.<br>
In PUvanam he vouchsafed to appear in beauty,                               (50)<br>
And showed His ancient spotless form.<br>
In VAthavUr he came sweetly gracious<br>
And caused the sound of His tinkling anklets to be heard.<br>
In Perun-turrai's blissful home, a Blessed One He dwelt,<br>
And guileful, in undimmed lustre hid Himself.                               (55)<br>
In PUvalam, beauteous, sweet and gracious,<br>
He sin destroyed.<br>
A water-booth he placed, to gain the victory,<br>
And graciously became an attendant who serves water.<br>
He came a guest to VenkAdu.                                                 (60)<br>
Beneath the Kurunthu tree He sat that day.<br>
In royal Mangai, in fair beauty throned,<br>
The eight great mystic powers in grace He gave.<br>
Becoming a hunter, and assuming the form He desired,<br>
In the forest with guile He lay hid.                                        (65)<br>
Exhibiting a body, assumed at pleasure,<br>
He bore the fitting form.<br>
In Jackal-town well pleased in grace<br>
He became an earthly babe.<br>
In PANTUr He came to dwell.                                                 (70)<br>
In the resplendent island, in the south of DEvUr,<br>
He assumed kingly state.<br>
In sacred ArUr, famed for its honey-dripping groves,<br>
He bestowed the gift of wisdom.<br>
In Idai-maruthu, by hosts attended,<br>
He planted His pure foot.                                                   (75)<br>
Assuming the nature of Ekambam,<br>
He became partner with his never-sundered queen.<br>
In glory He dwelt in sacred VAnjiyam,<br>
And delighted in the society of her of perfumed locks.                      (80)<br>
He became an attendant bearing a mighty bow,<br>
And assumed many various appearances,<br>
He dwelt in a spacious home in KadambUr;<br>
And showed Himself in beauty in the hill IngOy.<br>
He became a Caivan in AiyAru.                                               (85)<br>
He abode with desire in Turutti.<br>
In the 'town of the sacred palm' He dwelt desired.<br>
In Karumalam He manifested His presence.<br>
In the 'Vulture's Hill' He dwelt without a flaw.<br>
In Purrambayam He taught virtues manifold.                                  (90)<br>
In KutRAlam He was for a sign.<br>
Concealing His endless greatness in form of fire,<br>
In beauteous disguise the only primal One assumed a form,<br>
In magic splendour came in grace,<br>
Took each one's nature into Himself,-                                       (95)<br>
Being the infinite Lord of grace, our king,-<br>
Became a Sage as moonlight bright.<br>
Thro' upper air descending to the beauteous LAND<br>
He came in fairest form and filled with grace,-<br>
Lord of the HILL MahEnthiram, mountain of mystic lore,                     (100)<br>
The King of grace, immeasurably great !<br>
<br>
If one could tell the way He made me His:<br>
He showed His sacred form of power and grace;<br>
He exhibited His BANNER of sacred ashes;<br>
The RIVER of rapture that straightway                                      (105)<br>
All human vileness sweeps away, in grace He gave:<br>
The Partner of the DAME, in mercy great !<br>
While the great NATHA-DRUM spake loud<br>
He made me His, so that impurity touches not.<br>
He bears the mystic SPEAR,                                                (110)<br>
The splendour He whose flame pure light emits,<br>
Who cuts away the primal threefold bond;<br>
A loving one, the lotus GARLAND blue<br>
In fragrant loveliness He wore;<br>
Hari and BrahmA knew not Him to mete;                                      (115)<br>
On prancing charger forth He rode.<br>
He shows in grace the way knows no return;<br>
The old dominion of the PAndi LAND is His;<br>
<br>
He bears to bliss supern His pious saints<br>
Uttara-KOca-Mangai is His TOWN;                                           (120)<br>
To the primeval Beings He gives grace,<br>
The GOD OF GODS His sacred NAME; <br>
His VEHICLE is gift of joy dispels the dark;<br>
His the MOUNT of grace that greatness gives,<br>
Fitted to each one's lofty nature, each one's power;                       (125)  <br>
Meetly in love He makes them His;-<br>
Me, cur, in Tillai filled with good,<br>
He bade draw nigh th'all-glorious company;<br>
Yet, Ah ! He left me here.<br>
That day His servants who gained grace to go with Him,                     (130)<br>
Mingled in perfect union with Himself,<br>
While those that gained it not leaped on the fire !<br>
Then did bewilderment come over them,<br>
On earth they rolled, they fell, they wailed,<br>
They rushed with eager foot to reach the sea;                              (135)<br>
'Our Lord, Our Lord', they wept and called.<br>
<br>
While those who gained His foot pressed near,<br>
And cried, 'Celestial Dancer, who to Patanjali gave grace,'<br>
And yearned to gain satiety of bliss,<br>
He dances 'mid the company of beauteous 'Tiger-town',                     (140)<br>
That golden beauty like HimAlaya wears,<br>
There to Umai, whose roseate mouth is filled with sweetness,<br>
And to KAli grants the beauteous smile of His blest countenance.<br>
Thus the King with His assembled saints<br>
Joyous hath entered 'Tiger-town,' with garners filled,                    (145)<br>
High Lord of Kailai that resounds with rapturous song.<br>

<h3>
HYMN III - thiruvanndappahudi<br>
THE NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSE</h3>
<br>

This poem has an introduction of twenty eight lines, after which the 
praises of Civan are intermingled with somewhat intricate but ingenious 
allegories. The whole partakes of the nature of a rhapsody, - not without some 
sublimity, - and can be fully appreciated by those only who have studied the 
whole Caiva system as shown in Notes I-XVII.  It is an imitation, it 
would seem of the Sanskrit Catarudriya or Hyme to Rudra.  Yet, Civan - the 
Auspicious - is imagined by the Tamil Caivaites quite otherwise than by the 
northern and more ancient authorities Civan in the south is the Guru, the 
friend, ulmost the familiar companion, of His votaries, and is addressed with a 
mixture of awe and of simple affection that has a peculiar effect . Through all 
MAnikkaVacagar poems this personal relation of the God as manifested Guru to His 
devotees or disciples is, of course most prominent. I am not aware of anything 
quite like this in the mythology of the north though among the worshippers of 
Vishnu in His various incarnations something analogous may exist.<pr>

 Here lines 1-12 are very intricate, and emphasize two thoughts (1) 
that the Supreme in His greatness embraces all, and pervades the minutest things 
in His universe; and (2) that He is the unique Being, whose wondrous and admirable 
sublimity is not to be fully comprehended by any finite beings, gods or men.  
The two epithets the the Great One (line 6), and the Beautiful one. (line 12). <p>

The idea of lines 13-16 is peculiar to the Caiva system, which 
teaches that there are three great processes carried on by Civan, the Supreme, 
in the Universe. In the beginning of each aeon He evolves the phenomenal 
universe, and through countless ages sustains it as the theatre of births and 
deaths - of the whole drama of metampsychosis; and at the end of each aeon He 
 involves the phenomenal universe in its primal elements. These three 
processes of evolution,conservation and involution, are commonly assigned to three 
deities, of whom BrahmA is the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Civan the 
Destroyer.  This however was seen  to give to Civan an office apparently inferior, and 
certainly less gracious, than that which belongs to the other Gods.  
The South-Indian Caiva system boldly faces this difficulty. According 
to it there is really but one God.  He is called, among many other names, Civan 'the 
Blessed One'. Vishnu and BrahmA and the other so-called gods are but dependent 
'souls' like the rest, and at the beginning of each aeon their place and office for 
that aeon are assigned them by the Supreme as the result of merits accumulated.  
The BrahmA of the present aeon is the Demiurge or fashioner of 
The evolved Universe:  he puts it into shape, and is the mere agent of Civan. 
This system invites us to contemplate the universe at the beginning of 
each aeon awaiting the action of the Supreme.  Existence is eternal; it is subject to 
what are called deluges, or overhelming catastrophes, in which all the heavens, 
and all the regions of the abyss, all worlds, and all beings are restored to their 
rudimental condition, after which, by the will and operation of Civan 
they resume their normal manifestations. What exists at the beginning of an 
aeon <p>
First, we have the Lord, Pathi, Sivan, PerumAn.  He is the First Cause 
of all things; the only God.
Inseparable from Himself, dwelling in Him,is His personified energy or 
Sakti --- his bride said to be the originator, source, fountain, beginning of 
all emotion, action, wisdom, and grace. <p>
Secondly, we have Souls, lives, atomic existences,the flocks, pacu. These have 
now no embodiment , no powers, energies, or faculties,abiding like birds 
sleeping in the night on the branchces of some mighty tree, hardly to be 
distinguished from the tree itself, save that they live.   These are definite in 
number, and are eternal; no addition can ever be made to the number of souls 
that are alive in the universe, none of them can ever die.  Since, as we shall 
see, these may gain absolute identification with Civan-PerumAn and thus be 
embodied no more, the number of embodied souls diminishes; but no soul ceases to 
exist even after obtaining release, and being taken into God.  It may be, 
according to this system, that the time shall arrive when all embodied lives 
have obtained release, and then the worlds will for ever cease and Civan be all 
in all.  Each of these souls  has its load of deeds which are stored up, and are 
a' parte ante, eternal; the result of which, in pleasure or in pain, each soul in 
some embodied form must experience. As the Caiva system says, The fruit of deeds 
must be eaten '<p>
     These souls, at the beginning of each aeon, crouch waiting for their 
embodiments.  There are now no evolved worldsno heaven, no hell, no gods and demons, men. 
 All these have been, and shall be,but now are not.  That SOULS may be furnished with 
embodiments, and with worlds in which they may experience their fate, we have  
thirdly, the Bond, pAcam the eternal material cause of the creation. This is 
threefold, pure maya, impure maya and prakrithi, the of offspring of the latter, 
which is undefined. These three categories PATHI, PACU and PACAM - which we call 
roughly 'The God, SOUL AND MATTER' Are the subjects expounded in the Caiva 
Siddhantha Philosophy.<p>

The Sea and the Cloud<br>
<br>
Lines 66-95 are well nigh untranslateable, for they contain a subtle and 
intricate allegory, by means of which the grace of the manifested Civan, who is 
praised under the title of the 'Cloud' is set forth.  The idea is that the 
Infinite sea of rapturous supreme felicity is Civan, but - as the Cloud in the 
monsoon season sucks up water from the sea, and rises in black masses that cover 
the sky, while all the phenomena of the wonderful outburst of the beneficient, 
but also fearful, monsoon are exhibited - so does the Supreme manifest Himself 
as the Guru, the Object of Love, and Give of grace to His worshippers.  In the 
monsoon season, lightnings flash from one end of the sky to the other, crested 
torrents sweep down over the hills, bearing with them uprooted plants and trees, 
and not unseldom huge snakes that have been disturbed from their rocky mountain 
hiding places. The various kinds of 'Gloriosa' spread forth their beautiful 
flowers like supplicating hands, while every valley and hollow is filled with 
water. Meanwhile, as the heat is most intense just before the burst of the 
monsoon, the poet pictures a troop of thirsty antelopes, deluded by the mirage 
which seems to offer them refreshing streams and shade: disappointed they are 
left to die of thirst in the wilderness.  Meanwhile the pain of the fierce heat 
has ceased.  Down the gorges of the hill the torrent rushes, and is received 
into tanks prepared for it by the expectant husbandmen.  These lakes are 
fragrant with beautiful flowers, and on their banks the maidens have kindled 
fires with aromatic woods, at which they dry their hair and garments after the 
refreshing bath.  The cultivators may now sow their seed and expect a rich 
harvest.  All this is the work of the black clouds which drew water from the sea 
to fertilise the earth.  In these lines every particular of the description has 
its mystical meaning, which hardly needs illustration.  The student will compare 
VII, 61-64.<br>

 <br>
The ancient sea of bliss supreme is THAT indeed !<br>
Appearing like a black vast CLOUD,<br>
Arising in the hill of Petun-turrai blest,<br>
Whilst sacred lightnings flash frorn every point -,<br>
While serpent bright of sensual bondage dies -,                     (70)<br>
While the sore sorrow of the fervent heat hides itsellf;<br>
While the all-beauteous Hibiscus shines forth,<br>
Swelling in its wrath like our mortal pain,<br>
It sounds forth in mighty grace as a drum.<br>
While the kAnthal stretches out supplicating hands,                  (75)<br>
And the tender drops of sweet unfailing grace distil,<br>
While the gleaming torrent swells on every side,<br>
And rises to the highest banks of every lake -;<br>
The 'demon-car' of the six sects<br>
Excites the thirst of the large-eyed antelope throng.               (80)<br>
And they with eager desire crowd to drink;<br>
And faint with unquenched thirst haste hither and thither:-          <br>
Meanwhile, the heavenly mighty stream<br>
Rises and rushes, crowned with hubbles of delight,<br>
Eddies around, dashes against the bank of our 'embodiment,          (85)<br>
And twofold deeds of ours growing from age to age, -<br>
Those mighty trees, roots up and bears away.<br>
It rushes through the cleft of the high hills,<br>
Is imprisoned in the encircling lake,<br>
Where grow the expanded fragrant flowers,                            (90)<br>
In tank, where rises smoke of the agil, where beetles hum;<br>
And as it swells with ever-rising joy,<br>
The ploughmen-devotees in the field of worship<br>
Sow in rich abundance seed of love <br>

The Incomparable told out His nature as it is,<br>
That those like me might hear.<br>

He as a BrAhman showed His glory forth,<br>
Then, while undying love dissolved my frame, I cried;                 (150)<br>
I raised enraptured voice above the billowy sea's loud waves;<br>
In utter wilderment I fell, I rolled, I cried aloud,<br>
Madman distraught, and as a maniac raved;<br>
While those who saw were wildered, who heard it wonder'd sore.<br>
More than the frenzy wild of raging elephant                          (155)<br>
Bore me away beyond endurance far. 'Twas then through all my limbs<br>
A honied sweetness He infused, and made me blest.<br>
The ancient city of His foes with fire lit by His beauteous smile<br>
He caused to fall.  Ev'n so that day<br>
With mighty fire of grace our humble dwellings                       (160)<br>

With tender soul, as though He'd make me as Himself,<br>
He formed for me a frame where grace might flow.<br>
And as an elephant explores fields of sweet cane, at last<br>

While saints from the four quarters praised with all their sentient powers,<br>
Eager that day Thy foot and crown to know,                       (5)<br>
He then became a fierce strong boar, and rushing on<br>
Dug down through sevenfold regions, wearied cried at last:<br>

Thus was I born into the sad sea of th' afflictive life.          (25)<br>

I gained and hoarded gains. How varied was my life!.<br>
Morning's routine, hunger in noontide hour, and night<br>
For sleep. In journeys oft I lived.<br>
Jet black locks, and crimson lips, and radiant smiles were hers;   (30)<br>
Into love's sea I plunged.<br>
                                                ..             (31-35)<br>
In the wide marts where foolish worldlings toil<br>
I lived, still slave to fierce desires.<br>
I lived by sea of learning multiform;<br>
I lived in sorrow men call wealth;<br>
I lived 'mid ancient stings of poverty,                           (40)<br>

Nor did I greatness of the Sage superne contemn,<br>

Like shadow from its substance parting not,<br>
Before, behind, at every point, to it I clung.<br>
My inmost self in strong desire dissolved, I yearned;                 (80)<br>
Love's river overflowed its banks;<br>
My senses all in Him were centredl; 'Lord !' I cried.<br>
With stammering speech, and quivering frame<br>
I clasped adoring hands; my heart expanding like a flower.<br>
Eyes gleamed with joy and tears distilled.                             (85)<br>

HYMN V - thirucathakam<br>
THE SACRED CENTO.<br>
RELIGIOUS ENTHUSIASM.</h3>
<br>
Introduction to the Sacred Cento<br>
<br>
This remarkable poem contains a hundred especially flowing and harmonious verses 
of varying metres.  These are divided into ten decades, and the whole are 
connected by the law which requires that the last word of each verse shall begin 
the following verse. The whole ten lyrics with their hundred verses are thus 
linked together.  This arrangement, which is very common in Tamil, is called 
AnthAthi, which I venture to translate 'anaphoretic verse'.  This cento is 
intended to exhibit the progress of the soul through the successful stages of 
religious experience till it loses itself in the rapture of complete union with 
the Supreme.  The general titile given by one editor is equivalent to 'The 
Varying Phases of Religious Enthusiasm' at least this is the nearest expression for 
it that I can find in English.  The poem is supposed to have been composed in 
Tiru-peran-turai immediately after the departure of the Saints, for some time 
MAnikka-VAcagar's companions, who passed through fire and went home to Civan. 
From the border of the tank, where the divine conflagration had arisen, into he 
midst of which his companions had thrown themselves, he returned to the Kondral 
tree, where he spent a long period in solitary meditation, of which these poems 
are the sum.  He surveys his past experiences, contemplates the work assigned 
him and while he begins the series of sacred poems by which he was to establish 
the Caiva system n the hearts of his fellow-countrymen, he never ceases to 
complain in most touching language, that he is not permitted at once to follow 
his Master and brethren into the rest and glory of Paradise.  This is indeed the 
burthen of much of his poetry.<p>
     The titles of the ten decades, into which the poem is divided, indicate in 
some measure the course of his thoughts and the character of his mental 
conflicts.  There is a most pathetic alternation of rapturous and realising 
devotion with coldness and apathy, and even, it seems of temporary abandonment 
to gross sensuality.  It is to be doubted whether the whole of these verses are 
of one period, and I should prefer to think that they really embody his 
meditations and solloquies up to the period of his final settlement in 
Cithambaram.<br>
<br>
DECAD 1.<br>
<br>
THE COGNITION OF THE TRUE.<br>
<br>
1.  Humble access to the New Master<p>
My frame before Thy fragrant foot is quivering like al1 opening bud;-<br>
My hands above my head I raise; while tears pour down, my melting soul, <br>
The false renouncing,, praises Thee; with songs of triumph praises Thee,-<br>
Nor suffer I adoring hand to rest;-O Master, look on me !                (4)<br>
<br>
II.  Self-surrender. He accepts the ascetic life.<p>
I ask not bliss of Indra, MAl, or Ayan;-though my house and home<br>
Be ruin'd, friendship form I none save with Thine own; though hell's abys<br>
I enter, I unmurmuring go, if grace divine appoint my lot;-<br>
O King I no other god save Thee I ponder, our Transcendent Good !        (8) <br>
<br>
III. He is despised as a mad enthusiast.<p>
Transcendent Good ! Owner and Sire ! Thy servant melting thinks on Thee.<br>
In raptures meet I utter forth my fever'd soul's ecstatic joys,<br>
Still wandering from town to town; while men cry out, 'A madman this;'<br>
And each one speaks, with mind distraught, discordant words. O, when come  death ?                                               (12)<br>
<br>
IV.  None to be worshipped but Civan<p>
Erewhile was Dakshan's offering death. They ate the flesh, and poison feared<br>
' Our Father,' cried our friends and worshipt Him with suppliant voice.<br>
And yet  'Three are the gods that rule in heaven and earth,' they vainly deem.<br>
What sin is this your haughty minds breathe out, ye errirng penitents ?  (16)<br>
<br>
V. I plead no merit- am no real devotee.<p>
No penance have I done, nor bowed, with hand unstinting scatt'ring flowers;<br>
Born all in vain,-to ' cruel deeds ' a thrall,-the bliss of Civan's heav'n,<br>
Amongst Thy loving ones, I've fail'd to gain; see, and in grace bestow <br>
On me, Thy slave, consummate life beneath Thy feet, Supernal Lord !       (20)<br>
<br>
VI.  Grace unfailing to the faithful<p>
They roam'd and cull'd choice varied flowers to lay in worship at Thy feet,<br>
They deemed that all they sought they should obtain; and from these loving<br>
hearts<br>
In mystic guile Thou hidest still, abiding not ! In grace bestow,<br>
Love to Thy glorious foot, that I may ceaseless praise with perfect song !   (24)<br>
<br>
VII.  Civan was an ascetic,as am I now. <p>
Erewhile the Maker's-maker bowed, brought blooming flowers, and everywhere<br>
Sought for Th' All-seeing One, nor found. Our mighty One, Who dwells beyond,<br>
Here in the wilds with demons danced, a homeless, friendless one; and there<br>
In tiger-skin arrayed Himself, as madman wand'ring to and fro !         (28)<br>
<br>
VIII.  Save Thy servants in the day of doom!<p>>
The wand'ring wind, the fire, the flood, the earth, the heaven,-a time shall be<br>
When these adown the gulf shall go ! After that hour unknown has come<br>
The deeds-mighty the soul to bind-Thy slave in wand'ring days has done<br>
Let the time come for these to pass ! Guard us from these, our Guardian then ! (32)<br>
<br>
IX.  Bhavan's our Lord.<p>
Bhavan's our Lord, Whose garland is the cool vast moon, of heavenly one<br>
The Prince. Civan's our Lord,Who made me His, my meanness though He saw<br>
Our Lord Supreme is He, and I, His lowly servant, thus declare !<br>
That earth may know, sound out that Bhuvan is our Lord !         (36)<br>
<br>
X. 'Tis wondrous grace that sought me out.<br><br>
Unmeet was I to enter 'mongst Thy loving ones, my flawless Gem !<br>
Ambrosia rare ! The way Thou took'st me for Thine own and mad'st me meet<br>
The very meanest lifting high, Thou didst the heav'nly ones bring low !<br>
What Thou our Lord to me hast done is as a play men laugh to see !      (40)<br>
<br>
<br>
DECAD  II<br>
<br>
THE IMPARTATION OF DIVINE KNOWLEDGE.<br>
<br>
XI.  A prayer for perfect love-<br><br>
'Midmost of Thy devoted ones, like them in mystic dance to move;<br>
Within Thy home above to gain wish'd entrance, lo, I eager haste !<br>
O golden-glorious Hill of gems ! Give grace, that ceaseless love to Thee.<br>
Our Master, in my heart of hearts, melting my very soul, may 'bide.     (44)<br>
<br>
XII.  Longing for grace alone.<br><br>
I dread not any birth. To death what should I owe ! Nor do I crave<br>
Even heaven itself to gain. No power to rule this earth do I esteem.<br>
O Civan, crowned with cassia-flowers that sweets distil; our PerumAn !<br>
Our only Lord! I fainting cry: ' When comes the day I find Thy grace ?'    (48)<br>
<br>
XIII.  Without Thy presence I pine<br><br>
I ever pine Thy flow'ry feet to see, -Thy slave, dog though I am !<br>
I sit, no fitting flowers present, my tongue no rising raptures speaks.<br>
Thou Who the well-strung golden bow didst bend ! Ambrosia of Thy grace<br>
If Thou give not, I PINE,-a wretch forlorn,-what other can I be?     (52)<br>
<br>
XIV.  Deadness of soul.<br><br>
My inmost self PINES not, as were befitting, for Thy sacred Foot;<br>
Nor melts in love; I bring no wreath; speak out no worthy word of praise<br>
Within the shrine of Him, the King of gods, perform no service due;<br>
Nor move in dance. To death I haste ! Thou Whom true wisdom bringeth nigh!   (56)<br>
<br>
XV.  God all in all <br><br>
Thou art the Heaven; Thou art the Earth; Thou art the Wind;Thou art the Light!<br>
The Body Thou; the Soul art Thou; Existence, Non-existence Thou;<br>
Thou art the King; these puppets all Thou dost make move, dwelling within<br>
That each one says: ' Myself and mine. 'What shall I say? How render PRAISE (60)<br>
<br>
XVI.  My praise is pure. Free me from embodiments.<br><br>
The heavenly ones adore Thee still heaven's bliss to share ! Their minds to Thee<br>
They lowly humble that, on high exalted, men may worship them;<br>
Thou round whose flower-wreath hum the honey-bees ! Thy slave, I praise<br>
Thee, even I, that Thou may'st save from idle round of earthly birth !      (64)<br>
<br>
XVII.  The bliss of Civan's heaven of presence. <br><br>
The heavenly dwellers chaunt Thy praise; the fourfold VEdas utter song;<br>
She of the shining locks that shed perfume is sharer of Thy seat;<br>
There in true love Thy servants all commingling dwell; there, more and more,<br>
Thy feet with sounding anklets girt do they behold, Thou hard to know !(68)<br>
<br>
XVIII.  This abandonment is unendurable.  <br><br>
Thou Whom 'tis hard to know, in sky and in the golden court revealed,-<br>
Our mighty One ! beneath the jewelled feet where I was made Thine own,<br>
No more I scatter fragrant flowers, nor wondering weep, nor melt in love.<br>
'Tis past my power to bear ! How can it be ? I die, insooth, I die !      (72)<br>
<br>
XIX.  He is above; we earthly still. <br><br>
With flow'ry arrows in the spring-time comes the god of soft desire,<br>
And witching smile of maidens fair, with rosy mouths and flower-wreathed locks !<br>
Poor soul, that pants and melts through these, Who made thee His, and thrilled thy frame,<br>
To-day hath gone and dwells in heaven; yet see, thou still art lingering here !  (76)<br>
<br>
XX.  O soul be wise!<br><br>
O soul, that livest here in joy ! Of life's true joys bereft, in mire<br>
Thou sink'st of 'mighty deeds '! Him Who guards men from sinking praisest not !<br>
Thou art devising ruin to thyself,I tell thee so full oft;<br>
Thou'rt sinkcing even now beneath the FLOOD of the distressful sea! (80)<br>
<br>
DECAD  III.<br>
DYING TO SENSE AND SELF.<br>
<br>
This decad describes the mystic experience known by Caiva Siddhantha, as 
NAna-Carithai, in which the devotee, though able to discern God in and above and 
beyond all things, continues to perform outward rites (Carithai) and to avail 
himself ofall means of grace. See Civa-PragACam II.48.  Since Civan so deigns to 
manifest, and yet vell, His presence, the devotee is assiduous n performance of 
all prescribed acts of worship, while his soul transcends the visible, and by 
NAnam (in this connection = divine faith) sees God.<br>
<br>
XXI.   I have relapsed into apathy.<br><br>
Through Thine expanding locks the FLOOD pours down;<br>
   <dd>     the Bull is Thine, Lord of the heavenly ones ! -<br>
They sang, and stood, with panting, melting souls,<br>
     <dd>    like torrent, plunging in th' abyss ! and I,<br>
With yearning soul I heard ! Thou mad'st me Thine ! Yet now<br>
     <dd>    from head to foot, I melt not;from my eyes<br>
The rushing waters pour not down;my heart<br>
      <dd>    is stone;both eyes are wood to SINFUL me ! (84)<br>
<br>
XXII.  Deadness has come over me.<br><br>
Thou ent'ring stood'st by me fast bound IN SIN;<br>
      <dd>    as one who says, ' I'm sin's destroyer, come !'<br>
Thyself announcing thus, Thou mad'st me Thine,-<br>
       <dd>    becam'st my mighty Lord. Like iron statue, I<br>
Now sing no praise, nor dance, nor weep, nor wail,<br>
        <dd>   nor faint with bliss. Behold, O Primal One,<br>
To Thee I make my plaint; nor know how this<br>
       <dd>   with me shall end, Thou Who art First and Last !(88)<br>
<br>
XXIII.  Very vile, but Thine, save me!<br><br>
Thou'rt Ayan, Thou the fourfold VEdas' Lord;<br>
       <dd>   I know Thee,-I, lowest of men that live;<br>
I know,-and see myself a very cur;-<br>
      <dd>   yet Lord, I'll say I am Thy loving one !<br>
Though such I was, Thou took'st me for Thine own<br>
       <dd>  Thy saints are here no longer, only I,<br>
Vile wretch ! and is it thus Thy greatness shines ?<br>
      <dd>   Our PerumAn, what shall I say to Thee ? (92)<br>
<br>
XXIV.  Thy votary, though full of sin.<br><br>
And if I spake, ' Thou'rt ICan, Father, Sire<br>
       <dd>   great PerumAn ;' thus have I ever said;<br>
If I besmear'd, 'twas sacred ash alone<br>
      <dd>    I smear'd, still praising Thee, our PerumAn;<br>
Who erst made those Thine own who'd passed by love<br>
      <dd>   o'er birth and death. In torrent plunged of lust<br>
And guile, behold me, spotless Hill of gems !<br>
      <dd>    Father ! 'Twas such an one Thou mad'st Thine own !     (96)<br>
<br>
XXV.  The mystery of His being.<br><br>
Thy colour is not red,-nor white Thy form;-<br>
      <dd>   Thou'rt Many, One; Atom, than Atom far<br>
Subtler; the heavenly host in 'wildered thought<br>
      <dd>   know not the way, Father, to reach Thy feet.<br>
Thou showd'st Thy form, Thy beauty didst display<br>
     <dd>   didst show Thy now'ry feet ! Me wandering, Thine<br>
Thou mad'st, safeguarding me from future ' birth ' !<br>
     <dd>    Our PerumAn, what shall I say, what THINK ? (100)<br>
<br>
XXVI.   Wonders of grace.<br><br>
Thou mad'st my THOUGHT Thy THOUGHT ! Of me, mere cur,<br>
     <dd>     Thou mad'st the eye rest on Thy foot's blest flower,<br>
Thou mad'st me bow before that flower alone ! My mouth<br>
     <dd>    Thou mad'st to speak abroad Thy gem-like word !<br>
My senses five to fill Thou cam'st, and mad'st me Thine.<br>
     <dd>    Ambrosial Sea of magic might ! O Mount ! Thyself<br>
Thou gav'st, Thy form like wild of roseate lotus flowers,<br>
      <dd>  to LONELY helpless me. Thou Only-Light !          (104)<br>
 <br>
XXVII.  The voyage<br><br>
I, LONELY, tost by billows broad of anguish sore,<br>
      <dd>     on the  great ' sea of birth,' with none to aid;<br>
Disturbed by winds of mouths roseate like ripened fruit,<br>
      <dd>     lay caught in jaws of the sea monster lust !<br>
' Henceforth,what way to 'scape ? ' I frequent cried ! then thought,<br>
       <dd>   and seiz'd the raft of Thy Five Letters ! So to me,<br>
O Primal One, Thou showd'st a boundless fertile shore,<br>
      <dd>   and mad'st the rash insensate one Thine own ! (108)<br>
<br>
XXVIII.  What He did for me.<br><br>
Him none by hearing know; He knoweth no decay;<br>
       <dd>    He hath no kin; naught asking, heareth all !<br>
While people of the land beheld, here on this earth<br>
      <dd>     to me, a cur, He gave a royal seat;<br>
To me, a dog, all things not shown before, He showed;<br>
      <dd>   all things not heard before, He caused to hear;<br>
And guarding me from future ' birth,' He made me His.<br>
       <dd>  Such is the wondrous work our Lord hath wrought for me !      112<br>
<br>
XXIX.   His appearing. <br><br>
The WONDER this ! Say, is there aught like this ?<br>
     <dd>    He made me servant of His loving saints;<br>
Dispell'd my fear, ambrosia pouring forth, He came,<br>
     <dd>    and while my soul dissolv'd, in love made me His own;<br>
The Sire, Male, Female, Neither, Ether pure, was He;<br>
     <dd>    as wondrous Fire; as End of all; beyond all far;<br>
His body like a flower of golden hue;<br>
     <dd>    our Civa-PerumAn, our Lord, OF GODS THE KING !         (116)<br>
<br>
XXX.  Triumph<br><br>
The GOD OF GODS, to king of gods unknown;<br>
     <dd>   King of the ' Three '; what teeming worlds create,<br>
Preserve, destroy; the First; Essence divine;<br>
     <dd>    the Sire of sires; Fa,ther, whose half the Mother is;<br>
The King of all ! He came, and made me, too, His own.<br>
      <dd>  Henceforth I'm no one's vassal; none I fear !<br>
We've reached the goal; with servants of His saints<br>
     <dd>    in sea of bliss we evermore shall bathe !           (120)<br>
<br>
DECAD IV<br>
<br>
THE SOUL'S PURlFICATION.<br>
<br>
XXXI.  The sluggish soul.<br><br>
Thou dancest not; thou hast no love for the DANCER'S foot; <br>
  <dd>     with melting thrill<br>
Thou singest not; thou throbbest not; thou bowest not down;<br>
  <dd>       the flower of His foot<br>
Thou wearest not; thou crownest it not with flowers; there's none like Thee,<br>
    <dd>     DEAD HEART !<br>
Thou seekest Him not through every street; thou wailest not; nothing know<br>
    <dd>      I thou dost !                                (124)<br>
<br>
XXXII.  The ungrateful, treacherous heart.<br><br>
My Sire came, entered, made His own me who knew naught; in mercy taught<br>
    <dd>    me all;<br>
Caused me to know the higher path; He loos'd my every bond !<br>
Despite the gain of changeless, sweetest gifts of grace,thou'rt changed, <br>
    <dd>   DEAD HEART !<br>
RUINED by thee, to all that's false subjected, thus I RUINED lie !         128<br>
<br>
XXXIII.  Heart unworthy of trust; insensible to complaint<br><br>
My foolish senseless HEART, that changing, RUIN bringst to me,<br>
Henceforth I trust thee nevermore;-assuredly on Civan's mighty arm<br>
The ashes thickly smeared thou saw'st, yet melted'st  not; this, body's bonds<br>
Thou rendest not,-nor can I bid restore the ruin thou hast wrought.        (132)<br>
<br>
XXXIV.  The utter folly of the fickle mind.<br><br>
Perish, O restless mind ! before the Master Absolute,<br>
A dog I lay; Thou didst enjoy His fragrant flowery Foot;<br>
But now thou'rt severed like a young and tender shoot; all former bliss<br>
Hast lost ! Truly I deem Thy wisdom and Thy greatness measureless !       (136)<br>
<br>
XXXV.  Insensible to infinite mercy.<br><br>
When He to heavenly ones inscrutable, of acce~s easy to His saints,<br>
Our hidden sin destroyed, and made me His, thou knew'st the melting joy !<br>
Yet, HEART thou hast not, hating all thy hidden sin, prepar'd an ample field for Him,<br>
Nor bow'd before the Master's healing Feet, the heavenly goal to gain !    
(140)<br>
<br>
XXXVI.  What remedy?<br><br>
If 'tis not given to pass the golden gate,-where all may entrance find,<br>
And whence none e'er departs;-nor yet to melt in love before the foot<br>
Of Him, my Sire, my Lord;-if there to me abound no more<br>
Ambrosia, every honied sweet;-a sinful man, what can I do for this ? (144)<br>
<br>
XXXVII.  A sinner - I quit thee not.<br><br>
What other sinners are there like to me, cur at the Master's Foot?<br>
Yet not a whit from me to sever is Thy sacred will; and thus,<br>
O Primal One, Thy Foot's fair flower if I should quit, arld yet live on,<br>
My soul is iron, stone my mind; my ear to what shall it compare !       (148)<br>
 <br>
XXXVIII.  Life, a long exile.<br><br>
The others all have reached the goal, yet I, who know not anything,<br>
Haste not to Thee who art all sweetness, Civan, King of Civa-world;<br>
Thou Spouse of her whose eye is like the tender fawn; long time<br>
I still abide, cherish this flesh, and so my death-in-life drags on ! 
(152)<br>
XXXIX.  How do I bear life?<br><br>
O bliss that ceases not ! O bliss beyond compare ! His bright flower-foot<br>
He gave; to me of kind more base than dogs, He showed the perfect way<br>
My Chief, who gave me grace sweeter than mother's love, I see not now !<br>
Yet in the fire I fall not, wander not o'er hills, nor plunge me in the sea ! 
(156)<br>
XL.  Still the senses' slave.<br><br>
'When Cupid's dart in springtide wounds, moonlight will scorch ;' of this I took!<br>
No heed; like milk 'neath churning stick I'm stirred by wiles of those of <br>
                fawn  like eyes.<br>
To Civan's city go I not, where grace as honey to the soul is given;<br>
To cherish soul within the body, still I eat, and garments still put on! 
(160)<br>
DECAD V<br>
<br>
THE RENDERING A FIT RETURN<br>
<br>
XLI.  I did not clearly apprehend Thine appearing.<br><br>
Like elephant two-handed I saw not<br>
My mind's true germ; I saw but sore distress.<br>
Thou bad'st me, 'come'; yet, 'mid the heavenly ones<br>
'Twas l alone passed not, the senses' slave. (164)<br>
<br>
XLII.  It must have been illusion. Is HE man?<br><br>
To all who apprehend that one bright Essence truly is,<br>
As female, male, or lifeless thing Thou art not known;-<br>
To me Thy servant, coming as Thou art, Thou didst appear !<br>
I saw Thee, yet I saw Thee not ! What visual juggle this !(168)<br>
<br>
XLIII.  When shall I really see Thee as Thou art?<br><br>
Thou Form unique, to even heavenly ones<br>
Unknown ! Thou Mystic Dancer, Who didst make me Thine !<br>
Me Thine ! On earth, in heaven, or when all these<br>
Have passed away,-WHEN shall I see Thy face?  (172)<br>
<br>
XLIV.  I am of earth, earthy.<br><br>
Thou Infinite, by men yet seen !  Beyond eye's ken<br>
Thou Essence gleaming bright ! Here, like a fledgling, I<br>
Would gladly leave this faulty frame; yet know I not<br>
Dweller in this sense-world-how I may Thee put on.<br>
(176)<br>
XLV.  Deadness of soul.<br><br>
I call not on Thee filled with mighty love,<br>
Nor render praise, nor fall in ecstasy<br>
'Tis with me as when death confronted Thee,<br>
Bowing before those lotus flowers Thy feet.     (180)<br>
<br>
XLVI.  Call me, take me once more.<br><br>
Call, take me 'midst Thy loving ones, Thou crowned<br>
With cassias, home of sweets and humming bees !-<br>
In 'midst, beneath, above, in all contained,<br>
Thou art, my Sire, ' like oil within the seed ! '(184)<br>
<br>
 XLVII.  The Self-sufficing sought out me.<br><br>
Fathcr and Mother, Lord ! To all besides.<br>
Sire, Mother, Lord: to Him all these are not !<br>
Erewhile within my inmost soul He entered,<br>
Whom none by thought can know, the Ever-blissful One !  188<br>
<br>
XLVIII.  I had but a glimpse of His glory.<br><br>
To Thee, nor wealth, nor want ! From heavenly ones to worms,<br>
And grass, (no limit), all Thou fillest,  -Being rare !<br>
I saw Thy Foot-gem limitless, yet swerved from Thee.<br>
This is the grief I stony-hearted have endured !         (192)<br>
<br>
XLIX.  An appeal.<br><br>
My bonds Thou loosed'st, mad'st me Thine ! And all<br>
The loving saints who ashes gave beheld.<br>
Thou didst exalt, within the temple court,<br>
Ev'n me Thou didst exalt, who knew not anything.(196)<br>
<br>
L.  I was not chosen for my wisdom or might.<br><br>
Thou Only-Wise ! Ambrosia ! me, a servile cur,<br>
When Thou didst take and make Thine own, was I then wise ?<br>
Thou saw'st my ignorance that day Thou mad'st me Thine !<br>
Ah, Lord of grace, was I then wise ? was I then strong ?(200)<br>
<br>
DECAD VI.<br>
<br>
OVERFLOWINGS OF JOY.<br>
<br>
LI. No possible return for such mercies.<br><br>
O Master, O my Mighty One, my Father, PerumAn, my births'<br>
Destroyer, Thou Who mad'st me Thine,-an evil wholly worthless dog,<br>
And throughly base; I cannot think, Thou see'st,-of any meet return to Thee,<br>
O Shining One, Lord of the Porch,-nor know I aught that I can do.     (204)<br>
<br>
LII.  I am still the senses' slave<br><br>
Mean cur, that knew not what to do, I gave myself to gain those things<br>
That false ones gain, who ne'er have seen Thy flowery Feet of ruddy gold.<br>
I saw and heard that Thy true saints set free from lies, had gained Thy fragrant Foot;<br>
Yet I,-false one,-O Warrior strong !  still eat, am clothed, and here abide.  
(208)<br>
LIII.  I only left !<br><br>
Thou Warrior strong from out Thy golden city cam'st, mad'st darkness flee;<br>
With Her the beauteous Queen didst deign to come. The glorious devotees<br>
Who grace had gained, approached Thy Feet. I saw, yet like a sightless hog<br>
That roams the village street, shall I still roam a wretch doomed to live on ? 
(212)<br>
LIV.  My love is weak<br><br>
Full many a saint through deathless time wrought penance,members mortified<br>
With frustrate hope to see Thee here ! Yet Thou didst sinful me Thy servant make.<br>
O Gem ! This frame with foulness filled wears not away. To see Thy face,<br>
The strong desire and love 'bide not in me; my Prince, how may I rise ?(216)<br>
<br>
LV.  Still I live this loathed life.<br><br>
Thy bride is Umai with the fawn-like eyes ! Thou cam'st and mad'st me Thine<br>
Ambrosia Thou, essential sweetness shed ! O Civan, southern Tillai's King<br>
Thy saints assembled 'neath Thy sacred sign have gone to gather round Thy feet<br>
This loathsome body still I guard, still here I dwell, O MASTER MINE !(220)<br>
<br>
LVI . Thy will ordains my exile.<br><br>
O MASTER MINE ! They think on Thee, Thy loving ones, with rapture filled<br>
They're Thine, Thy Foot I saw them join. Yet here more mean than village cur<br>
I dwell; my heart no rapture feels; my mind is stone, nor melts within.<br>
This body vile I still must guard and here abide,-such is THY WILL ! (224)<br>
<br>
LVII.  My old life of earthly love.<br><br>
The way THY WILL ordains befits me well ! Faithless I strayed, I left<br>
Thy saints. A reprobate was I I How did I watch the one belov'd,<br>
The quiverings of the lip, the folds of circling robe, the timid bashfull looks<br>
To read love's symptoms there ! My mind thus ruin to myself wrought out.   (228)<br>
<br>
LVIII.  Was my vocation a mockery then?<br><br>
Thou honied Sweetness, purest Joy, Souls' Light, Master Who fill'st with bliss<br>
The frame of those that trust in Thee, Giver of endless gifts ! Of worth.<br>
I void am yet Thy slave; Thou me hast made Thine own; if this be so<br>
Thy servant's state would show, I plead, Thy gift of grace was but Thy sport. 
(232)<br>
LIX.   What other refuge have I ?<br><br>
Thy nature others know not ! Lord ! Me evil cur, lowest of all,<br>
Hast Thou not made Thine own ? And wilt Thou let me go cast out from Thee?<br>
Then who will deign to look on me ? What shall I do, O PerumAn ?<br>
Father, whose sacred form is gleam of gold, where shall I refuge find? (236) <br>
<br>
LX.  I have sure hope; yet how unworthy!<br><br>
I shall enter beneath Thy Foot which is mine ! 'mid saints that adore I standing<br>
Shall laugh, glad as I gaze on the well-known form! shameless dog tho' I am !<br>
No melting love is here! To see Thee - to be made Thine own, - can I<br>
Be meet ? This abject state, Father ! behold, 'tis past my power to BEAR !(240)<br>
<br>
DECAD VII.<br>
<br>
THE OVERWHELMlNG SENSE OF THE DIVINE COMPASSION.<br>

Hail ! I pray Thee melt my soul within me, make me Thine !<br>

Hail ! CangarA, Who in Thy braided lock hast GangA placed ! (256)<br>
<br>
LXV.  Praise.<br><br>
Hail !  O CangarA, other refuge have I none !<br>
Hail ! Partner of the Queen of glorious form, of ruddy lips,<br>

Hail ! Guru of the heavenly ones ! Hail ! ! Tender Branch !<br>
Hail, bid me come, receive me ! grant Thy Foot to gain;<br>
And thus remove my lonely friendless woe ! (272)<br>

LXIX.  <br><br>
Hail, to those who love with perfect love, Giver of love surpassing theirs !<br>
Hail ! Greatness that oft my falsehood pardon'd, granted grace, and made me Thine !<br>
Hail ! Prince, Who drank the outpoured poison,-to the heavenly ones ambrosia gave !<br>
Hail ! Thy perfect Foot on me, a wretch, in grace bestow !   (276)<br>
<br>
LXX. The Universal Lord.<br><br>
Hail ! Thou Who art earth, water, fire, wind, ether too !<br>
Hail ! Thou, all life's phenomena,-Thyself invisible !<br>
Hail, all living beings' End,-Thyself without an end !<br>
Thyself reaching through all, by senses five unreached !  (280)<br>
<br>
DECAD VIII.<br>
<br>
MYSTIC UNION.<br>
<br>
LXXI. Sinking in rapture.<br><br>
Sire, as IN UNION strict, Thou mad'st me Thine; on me didst look, didst draw me near;<br>
And when it seemed I ne'er could be with Thee made one,-when naught of Thine was mine,-<br>
And naught of mine was Thine,-me to Thy Feet Thy love<br>
In mystic union joined, Lord of the heavenly land !-'Tis height of BLESSEDNESS. 
(284)<br>
LXXII. All bliss in God.<br><br>
For BLESSEDNESS I seek; not Indra's choice delights, nor those of other gods;<br>
Thou Only-One, I live not save with Thy Feet twain ! Our Lord,my breast is Riven,<br>
With trembling seized; my hands in adoration join;<br>
And from my eyes a ceaseless stream pours down, as of a river, O MY SAGE !(288)<br>
<br>
LXXIII.  Prayer for consummation.<br><br>
MY SAGE, save to Thyself there's none to whom I cling;-in me, deceitful one<br>
No part from mingled falseness 'scapes; I'm falsehood's self !Partner of Her whose dark<br>
 Eyes gleam, come Thou to me ! the love Thy true ones feel,-<br>
Who at Thy jewell'd Feet in love commingling rest,-mine be it too, I PRAY ! (292)<br>
<br>
LXXIV.  Give me essential oneness.<br><br>
I PRAY for love of Thine own jewell'd Feet; remove the false; Thine own<br>
Make me in truth; dog though I am,O bid me come, in grace join to Thyself<br>
    For ever more Thine own ! So let me ceaseless praise,    <br>
Thro' every world returning ever come; my King, that I may WORSHIP THEE ! 
(296)<br>
LXXV.  Thou art sole actuality<br><br>
THEE WORSHIP both the earth and heaven, with shouts of joy, and fourfold mystic scroll:<br>
They yearning pine for Thee. For they who gain Thee know naught true exists but Thee.<br>
  Ah ! since we vow to quit Thy service never, come     <br>
And grant Thy grace,Thou Partner of the lovely Queen ! Pausingwhy PONDER so ?(300)<br>
<br>
LXXVI. He transcends  thought and speech.<br><br>
WHEN PONDERING Thee the thought goes forth, to reach the bound desired by  fitting word<br>
Is not a whit attainable; nor are these things one hears through forms of speech.<br>
Thee, Who art all the world, the senses five know not.<br>
How GAIN the Father's Foot that rests in all that is and every sphere beyond?  
(304)<br>
<br>
LXXVII.  Pity me !<br><br>
To me, a guileful soul, who thought to GAIN Thee, Lord, salvation save by Thee<br>
Is none. No other Being truly is, save Thee ! Lest pining sorrow come,<br>
 <dd>  In mercy to my sin, my soul vouchsafe to guard.<br>
'Tis pitying grace like this alone RULER SUPERNE ! Thy glory doth beseem. (308)<br>
<br>
LXXVIII.  My soul clings to Thee.<br><br>
' RULER SUPERNE, there's none butThee, or here or there,' and thus I ever spake,<br>
Fool though I was, there was no difference ! Our Lord: Thou Spotless One,<br>
  <dd>    Who didst<br>
      Make me, an outcast wretch, Thine own, my Teacher Thou,<br>
The THOUGHT, that other god exists than Thee the One, my mind shall never THINK !(312)<br>
<br>
LXXIX.   Old days of ignorance.<br><br>
BY THOUGHT, by deed, by hearing, or by speech, or by these wretched senses five<br>
I failed in days of old Thy truth to reach;- I, low and foolish one.<br>
  I passed not through the fire, my heart burst not with shame.<br>
To Thee, O Father, even yet may I attain ! May I yet dwell with Thee !       (316)<br>
<br>
LXXX.   Strange command: 'Tarry yet below.'<br><br>
Me iron hearted and deceitful one, Thine own Thou mad'st; Thy foot's sweet bliss<br>
Filled me with joy; with me Thou didst commingling join. The fire was there and I<br>
 Was there: that was which was ! Though this was so that day, <br>
There was in Thee desire for me, in me for Thee;-what ignorance was mine? 
(320)<br>
DECAD IX.<br>
<br>
ECSTASY.<br>
<br>
LXXXI.   Falsehood lingers yet.<br><br>
'The seed of lies is not destroyed ;'-so saying, Thou hast placed me here !-<br>
All those that were to Thy desire have come, and reached Thy sacred Foot ! -<br>
ln depths of fear I sink O God, Who didst in ArUr ask for alms,<br>
           What shall I do ? SPEAK Thou to me ! (324)<br>
<br>
LXXXII.  Resignation.<br><br>
Thou SPAK'ST to me, amid Thy saints with sacred ash I was besmeared;<br>
By men on earth as Thy poor slave I've been abused; henceforth, if what<br>
I suffer pleases not, 'tis what my soul desires, because I am<br>
           Thy SLAVE, whom Tho~ didst make Thine own !           (328)<br>
 <br>
LXXXIII.  Yet I know not why I'am left.<br><br>
And am I not Thy SLAVE ? and didst Thou not make me Thine own, I pray<br>
All those Thy servants have approached Thy Foot; this body full of sin<br>
I may not quit, and see Thy face,-Thou Lord of Civa-world!-I fear,<br>
      And SEE NOT HOW TO GAIN THE SIGHT !               (332)<br>
<br>
LXXXIV.  Tell me the hindrance to my instant freedom.<br><br>
I SEE NOT HOW THY SIGHT TO GAIN; though Thee THAT DAY I saw ! Speak Thou<br>
In music say what 'tis that weighs my spirit down,-O Light Superne !<br>
Male, Female, rare Ambrosia, Sire ! I die, a dog, of power bereft,<br>
  By what may I rise up, my Lord ?                 (336)<br>
<br>
LXXXV.  Falseness keeps me out.<br><br>
Thou Partner of the fawn-eyed Queen; Thou Word, whose end the Word<br>
        knows not;-<br>
Ambrosia sweet, to thought unknown; King, faults of wretched me Thou bear'st<br>
I babbling tell my woes. Thy saints have reached the city blest. OUTSIDE<br>
      I and my FALSENESS wander here !            (340)<br>
<br>
LXXXVI.  But O, the pity of it.<br><br>
OUTSIDE We go, FALSENESS and I !True love to gain I've lost the power.<br>
This is my gain! Thy saints to Thee who utterly are joined now,<br>
Know nothing else but Thee; in acts all glorious on their way they go !<br>
  O Civan, they have reached Thy FOOT ! (344)<br>
<br>
LXXXVII.  Failure !<br><br>
O Master, give Thy slave to love Thy FOOT; Thy servants now have gained<br>
The world from which they come not back; outside I have remained, I've tried<br>
'To crown the village cow, and so have crowned the blind !' From love, of<br>
        Thy twain Feet  <br>
Estranged, a slave I 'wildered WEEP !                  (348)     <br>
<br>
LXXXVIII. I am unworthy to be numbered with Thy saints.<br><br>
I WEEP ! With loving mind towards Thee, like wax before the fire were they.<br>
Thy gleaming, golden, jewelled Foot have they beheld, and worshipping<br>
Have followed Thee; not following on with them, in vain have I been born !<br>
      Wherewith shall I before Thee bow?                        (352)<br>
<br>
LXXXIX.  At least, take my sin away.<br><br>
In grace Thou hast put far all ills of those that bowed; on ancient saints<br>
Thou didst bestow Thy Foot adorned ! If that's too great for me, my guilt<br>
(Who'm like a tough bambu) destroy; come swiftly, give Thy healing Foot<br>
  Thou only True, from FALSEHOOD free !                 (356)<br>
<br>
XC.  Teach me Thy way.<br><br>
All FALSE am I; FALSE is my heart; and FALSE my love; yet, if he weep,<br>
May not Thy sinful servant Thee, Thou Soul's Ambrosial sweetness, gain ?<br>
Lord of all honied gladness pure, in grace unto Thy servant teach<br>
The way that he may come to Thee !                      (360)<br>

</H3>
<br>
This title, which forms the burthen of the poem, is given to one of the Sage's 
most interesting  compositions. It consists of fifty quatrains, constructed in a 
beautiful metre  (see my Second Grammar 192) which is in fact epichoriambic (as is 
explained in the notes to the Tamil text).<br>
<br>
     It is called AnthAthi poem.  This means that it is anaphoretic, the last 
word of a verse is to be repeated in the beginning of each following verse, and 
very often striking its keynote.  Hymn V is the same).  This has a beautiful 
effect in Tamil, but the difference of Idiom often forbids translator to attempt 
to reproduce it in English.<br>
<br>
     The poem throughout is a genuine human cry for Divine help in the midst of 
a terrible struggle and is full of the most vivid emotion.  It was composed,  
according to tradition, immediately after the wonderful cento that forms the 
fifth poem, and gives expression to the youthful devotee's feelings after 
his guru had finally departed, and the company of the 999 (?) saints who 
attended him had thrown themselves into the fire.  He is said to have gone round 
the Civan shrines in the PAndiyan Kingdom, and first of all to have spent some 
considerable time in the ancient city of Tiru-uttara-kOcamangai, which was at 
one time a PAndiyan capital, situate eight miles south-west of Ramnad, where the 
ruins of an important Civan shrine are yet to be seen.  There he suffered from 
the reaction  naturally consequent upon the excitement produced by the 
wonderful events of the preceding months.  He had been till now the petted, 
highly gifted favourite and prime minister of the PAndiyan Kingdom living in the 
midst of pomp and luxury, invested with almost absolute power; and was still in 
early manhood.  He finds himself at once a Caiva mendicant, who has renounced 
everything subsists on alms, and must spend his days and nights in solitary 
meditation.<br>
<br>
     Meanwhile the circumstances in which he finds himself placed the lives of 
his companions, the whole environment of the temple, are not favourable to pure and 
high devotion.  The lofty ideal is not realized here.  Then, as now, the 
influences surrounding and emanating from the shrine itself were in many ways 
deteriorating.  From the evidence of these verses, we conclude that there were two 
things from which he suffered.  One of these was the allurements of the female 
attendants who, in bands pertained to the temple.  We have noticed this elsewhere. 
Hindu commentators will often find mystic meanings, which are harmless, - if 
unfounded. Again and again in this and other poems he deplores the way in which he 
has been led to violate his vow.  The other difficulty, often referred to was the 
way in which mere ceremonial acts had to be performed, affording no relief to 
his conscience. He thus fell into a desponding and well-nigh despairing state of 
mind, and sent forth this cry like that heard in the Psalter, and reiterated by 
the greatest Being that ever trod the pathway of this human life.  Few things in 
literature have such a genuine ring as some of the verses in which young noble 
bewails his apparent desertion by his Master.  Yet he never quite lost his 
confidence and love; and afterwards, as many of the lyrics show, exchanged for 
the 'spirit of heaviness the garment of praise'.<br>

  <br>    I do not think that any one can be found who will withhold his sympathy 
from the Sage. It may be noticed, though it is in connection with the Tamil text 
that the matter must be more fully discussed, that there is a great difference, 
as it seems to me, between the style of the first twenty stanzas (where 
indeed it may be conjectured that the poem originally ended) and those that 
follow. Notably in verses 21-50 there is only reference to Uttara-kOca-mangai, 
which city in verses 1-20 is a part of the perpetual refrain.  These latter 
verses, too, are more ingenious and subtle, and are more ful of poetic fancies.  
Sometimes, indeed, they may seem to be even more beautiful than those that are 
the undoubted composition of the Sage.  Their language, rhythm, and manner seem 
to me, however, to be different.  But I readily acknowledge the difficulty that 
lies in the way of all merely subjective criticism, especially by a foreigner.  
Yet the exceedingly uncritical way in which these texts have been hitherto 
handled necessitates and justifies the attempt.<br>
<br>
     The writer did a great part of these translations at beautiful Lugano, not 
unfrequently relieving the toil by the enjoyment of an hour in the church of S. 
Maria degli Angoli, before the marvellous frescoes of Bernardino Luini; and 
could not help wishing oft times that the Tamil Sage and Seeker after God could 
have stood there, or haply knelt by his side.  Could Manikkavacagar have traced 
that history of the Great Master, of His passage from Gethsemane to the glory of 
His heavenly dwelling place, how would he have been affected?. One wonders!. 
It may be that he, and the weaver of MailApUr, and the  wandering sages of the NAladiyAr, and 
others whose legends we recall, have since, freed from the flesh, visited that 
spot.  Certainly they know those histories now! Shall we not in regard to our 
poet-sage, wherever his ashes are scattered, say hopefully and tenderly, 
Requiescat in pace?<br>

Those WARRING ELEPHANTS, the senses five, I feared,-was lost.<br>
THOU HAST FORSAKEN ME, Thou, hard to leave,-hard to attain,<br>
Save by Thy worthy saints, bright Gem ! While fierce fire raged,<br>
Poison hard won from out the sea, Thou mad'st Thy food, O Azure-throat!  (128)<br>
<br>
XXXIII.  Pardon my waywardness !<br><br>
That I wished to do I did,-wine of Thy grace I drank,-rejoiced;-<br>
Then swerved ! THOU HAST FORSAKEN ME ! Thy fragrant flowery Foot,<br>
As in the days of old Thou gav'st, command and bid me serve !<br>
Take me, my Father ! O remove this wayward FOND DESIRE !               (132)<br>

Of joy meet me, and all my mind with fragrant sweetness fill,<br>
As of the plantain fruit,-TRANSCENDENT LORD of Kailai's hill ?  (136)<br>
<br>
XXXV.   I am, though faulty, Thine !<br><br>
TRANSCENDENT LORD, with Thine own ancient saints, me faulty one<br>
Thou didst desire ! O Aran, yet LO ! THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME !-<br>
Thou didst me place near Thee, like the hare spots thou wear'st,-<br>
O mighty Warrior 'gainst birth's five-mouth'd snake, my soul would shun! (140)<br>
<br>
XXXVI.  Quench sensual fires.<br><br>
Like flames in forest glade sense-fires with smoky glare burn fierce !<br>
I burn !  LO, THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME ! O conquering King of heaven,<br>
The garlands on Whose braided lock drip honey, while the bees<br>
Hum softly 'mid MandAra buds, whence fragrant sweetness breathes. (144)<br>
<br>
XXXVII.  Is there no pity?<br><br>
O King, to me poor ignorant, 'Fear not for faults,' Thou didst<br>
Not say, but HAST FORSAKEN ME, O Thou with fragrance crowned !<br>
Spouse of the sea-born maid with sparkling gems and jet-black eyes !<br>
Bhuyangan ! Golden Foot ! My 'deeds' PRESS round like clustering hills. (148)<br>
<br>
XXXVIII.  I have erred through weakness.<br><br>
By senses PRESSED, fearing I left Thee, weak to quit the charms<br>
Of sweet-voiced maids. Lo ! THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME !  Thou radiant Beam<br>
King of the burning ground; Ambrosia to Thy worshippers;<br>
Hard to be gained; sole HELP, removing loneliness of lonely me !     (152)<br>
<br>
XXXIX.  Help me in this conflict with flesh.<br><br>
SOLE HELP, whilst Thou wert there I wandered wanton,-'deeds' my help !<br>
THOU HAST FORSAKEN ME, Thou Helper of my guilty soul;<br>
Thou Source of all my beings bliss; Treasure that never fails !<br>
No whit bear I this grievous body's mighty NET !               (156)<br>
<br>
XL.  The pain of sensuality.<br><br>
Caught by those eyes whose timid glance is like fawn's in the NET,<br>
'Wildered I grieved. Lo ! THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME ! Thou on Whose head<br>
The pale moon's crescent thin is seen ! Ocean of grace ! Thou Lord<br>
Of Kailai's hill ! Spouse of the mountain Maid ! Source Of my being's joy !  (160)<br>
<br>
XLI.  Woe is me, in this vile fleshy prison.<br><br>
In the hot flood of lust for those of ruddy lips, like crocodiles,-<br>
I eager plunged. Lo ! THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME ! This body foul,<br>
Ant-eaten, I endure not; Civan, list to my complaint !<br>
Thou Bridegroom of the beauteous Bride; my joyous Goal of bliss ! (164)<br>
<br>
XLII.  Grace once given, now withdrawn.<br><br>
Thou gav'st indeed to me in grace to gain my goal, Thy Feet;-<br>
Yet THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME, not fated to shake off this flesh !<br>
The moon beheld the serpent bright in skull-cave hid, and feared;-<br>
Then plunging hid his swelling crest within Thy braided lock, O KING ! (168)<br>
<br>
XLIII.  I adore Thee, though forlorn.<br><br>
O KING, to wretched me, who know not any path, the Light<br>
Of joy ! THOU HAST FORSAKEN ME !-Thou the true VEdic Lord<br>
To me didst speak, Who passed speech ! To steadfast worshippers,<br>
Thou art the First, the Last too,-Thou this universal Whole  !(172)<br>
<br>
XLIV. Tormented by lust.<br><br>
Like oil was I poured in fierce fire of glancing dartlike eyes,-<br>
LO ! THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME! Whose word erst joined me to Thy saints,<br>
Who ever worship at Thy fragrant flowery Feet; my Lord !<br>
My Master, faulty though I am, forsake me not ! Thee will I SING.  (176)<br>
<br>
XLV.  Spiritual desertion<br><br>
I SANG Thee not, nor worshipped Thee, O hidden Gem,-nor left this flesh.<br>
LO ! THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME ! All wonderment I wept, yet sought Thee not,<br>
Nor, 'Where is Civan,' 'Who hath seen Him?' did I haste to ask.<br>
I lay supine, my soul no raptures knew;-I suffered sore !        (180)<br>
<br>
XLVI.  Still will I adore the mysteries of Thy nature.<br><br>
Like fly in jack-fruit caught, I fell a prey to fawn-eyed maids !<br>
LO ! THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME ! But if Thou leave, I'll utter loud reproach !<br>
I'll call Thee 'Black-throat,' 'Who ate poison from the sea,' 'The Unqualified,'<br>
'The man,' 'Crowned with the waning moon,' 'The mighty God gone wrong.'    (184)<br>
<br>
XLVII.  Various wanderings.<br><br>
The ancient worship of Thy blameless Feet I gained; then fell;<br>
Reviled Thee; woke once more; and, LO ! THOU HAST FORSAKEN ME !<br>
Greatness, that heavenly Ganga stirs to shed bright gems and pearls !<br>
Thy WREATH'S the crescent in the water seen, caught in Thy braided lock ! (188)<br>
<br>
XLVIII.  I will boast Thy name.<br><br>
Hero, Who wear'st the fiery snake-WREATH on Thy starlike head !<br>
Lo I THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME; But if Thou leave when others ask<br>
'Whose servant Thou ?'  'Slave of the glorious slaves<br>
Of Uttara-kOca-mangai's King,' I'll name myself, and cause them SMILE at Thee. (192)<br>
<br>
XLIX. Ever praising.<br><br>
I'll make them SMILE, unfolding faults and service to the Lord !<br>
Lo!  THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME; but if Thou leave, I shall ABUSE Thee sore !<br>
'Madman, clad in wild elephant's skin;' 'Madman, with hide for his garb<br>
'Madman, that ate the poison;' 'Madman of the burning-ground-fire<br>
'Madman, that chose even me for His own !'                 (196)<br>
<br>
L.<br><br>
ABUSING Thee or praising,-crushed by sin, and grieved am I !<br>
LO! THOU'ST FORSAKEN ME, Thou Brightness on red coral hill !<br>
Thou madst me Thine; didst fiery poison eat, pitying poor souls,<br>
That I might Thine ambrosia taste,-I, meanest one !          (200)<br>

HYMN VII - thiruvempaavai <br>
(Cattiyai viyantatu)<br>
THE MAIDENS' SONG OF THE DAWNING</h3>
<p>
The mystic 'Song of the Maidens' forms a pendant to the 'Morning Hymn' (XX). It 
has always been attributed to Manikka-vACagar without any hesitation, though in 
many respects it is certainly unlike most of his other lyrics. It is said to 
have been composed for the use of the women at ArunACalam, among whom it is, and 
was, the custom to celebrate with great demonstrations of joy a festival in 
honour of the god Civan and the goddess Catti in the month of Margazhi, which 
corresponds to the second half of December and the first half of January. At 
that time the females of the city of all ages for ten successive days rise 
before dawn, and perambulate the precincts, arousing their companions from house 
to house, and proceeding to bathe (in rigidly decorous manner) in the sacred 
tank. There are passages in this poem which I have been obliged somewhat to 
veil, and modify, carefully preserving, however, the full and exact meaning of 
the original, as I conceive it. There is, however, connected with the Caiva 
worship, it must be said, a series of rites which is sometimes called the 
tantric, and sometimes the Cakti system. No doubt, in connection with this, many 
unspeakable abominations have been, and are at times perpetrated; and every 
thoughtful Hindu is sincerely anxious that all trace of these corruptions should 
be swept away. In all nations Similar things have existed, and it would be 
quite superfluous to enumerate the ancient rites of a similar character that 
have been enthusiastically celebrated. From such things the Caiva system must sever 
itself absolutely, which it can the more decidedly do, because they have no real 
root in the Caiva Siddhanta philosophy itself.<p>

         In one edition of these poems there is the introduction to the 
'Maidens' Reveille,' which gives a mystic interpretation to a large portion of 
the lyric. According to this author, from the month of Adi to the month of 
Margazhi (i.e. from July 15th to January 15th) is the night season; the other 
half of the year being the daytime;  the whole year forming a single day of the 
Gods. The former half of the year, in which there is rain with black clouds, is 
the representative of the secular period of involution  or destruction, when all 
things have been re-involved in the ripple veils of darkness, which period 
precedes that of the recreation, or evolution. The other half of the year 
represents the period of creation, i.e. the time during which the phenomenal 
universe is re-evolved from its eternal elements as the sphere of the activities of 
all things that have life. The month of Margazhi is then the symbol of the 
awaking of the universe from its slumber of involution. It is the dawn of the 
new creation,Ñ of secular evolution. [NOTE XIII].<p>

       Now this creation is the work of Catti, the manifested energy of 
Civan:Ñhis wife, who is the author, not of life indeed, but of the whole 
phenomenal system in which and by which life exerts its energy, and achieves its 
destinies. Civan himself can come into no personal relation with matter and its 
veiling delusions and darkness. It is, therefore, Catti that accomplishes the 
work; she is an energy of activity, of knowledge, and of desire; and through her 
alone the Supreme evolves all things. But this tantric system, like the gnostic 
systems of old, does not permit Catti as the Partner of the Supreme, to 
accomplish directly the work of evolution. This would be far too simple and 
direct for Hindu philosophy. There is a long chain of feminine manifestations 
(aeons evolved in succession, each coming into a relation to the Supreme that 
constitutes a distinct stage in the process; and it is only at last that BrahmA 
and Vishnu are evolved, to be respectively the fashioned and the maintainer of 
the cosmic world. The writer here enumerates nine of these Cattis amongst whom 
are numbered the chief female divinities that, under various names and epithets, 
are worshipped or propitiated in various parts of India. Among them is the 
dreaded KAli.  No doubt there are hints of all this in this poem, but its plain 
and obvious interpretation is the only one known to the majority of those that 
use it, and I imagine the composer himself was innocent of anything like the 
gnosticism and mysticism that his interpreters have given him credit for. As the 
hymn stands it is a beautiful composition, but in some parts it will seem to be 
somewhat obscure. I have tried to give a version that still be as literal as 
possible, but only the Tamil reader can feel how great a poet its author was; 
and only the student of the South-Indian Caiva philosophy can expect to enter 
into its spirit.<br>

I.  The temple worship<br>
(The waits sing at the door)<br>
The Splendour rare and great, that knows nor first nor end, <br>
   <dd>   we sing; Thou hear'st the song, yet still sleep'st on;<br>
O lady of the large bright eye ! is thine ear dull <br>
   <dd>  that it perceives not sound of praise that hails<br>
The great God's cinctured feet ?ÑShe hears the strain resound <br>
   <dd>  through all the street, yet in forgetful sleep<br>
On her flower-couch she muttering turns ! Ñ<br>
See, here she nothing noting lies ! Why thus, why thus ? <br>
    <dd> doth this our friend beseem ?-OUR LADY FAIR, ARISE !   (4)<br>
<br>
II.  Trifle not.<br>
'Hail to the heavenly Light,' thou ever say'st, as we,<br>
    <dd>   by night and day. Now of this flowery couch<br>
Art thou enamour'd, maid with faultless gems adorned ?<br>
    <dd>   Shame I jewell'd dames, are these things trifles too ?<br>
To sport and jest is this the place, when He in grace<br>
     <dd>     Hath come to give the foot-flower, shame fast angels praise ?<br>
The Teacher, Lord of Civa-world, in Tillai's porch He rules.<br>

        <dd>     [She joins them. They enter the temple porch]<br>
  <dd>  'Ye men devout, the Ruler's ancient saints, ye reverend men,<br>
Will't be amiss if ye our weakness aid, us novices admit ?' <br>
                <dd>              [in the temple]<br>

[ They all henceforth sing their morning song to the goddess, <br>
          <dd>   imploring HER to arise in grace]<br>
O thou of radiant pearl-like smile, is't not now dawn ?<br>
         <dd>  have not the sweet-voiced come, like parrots many-hued ?<br>
Thus thinking, as is meet, we speak; meanwhile in sleep <br>
       <dd>   close not Thine eye; let not thy time in vain be spent ! - <br>
Sole Balm of heaven, the VEda's precious Sense, the Dear <br>

V.  Say not, 'Civan is unknowable!'<br>
The 'Mount' that MAl knew not, and Ayan saw not,-we   <br>
    <dd>  can know; so Thou dost utter falsities, <br>
O guileful one, whose mouth with milk and honey flows,  <br>
    <dd>   ope thy door! He Whom earth, heaven, and other realms know not,<br>
In glory makes us His, cleanses our souls in grace.<br>
    <dd>    His goodness sing ! 'O Civan, Civan,' hark ! they cry.<br>
Thou understandest not; thou understandest not !- <br>
      <dd>  So's she with perfumed locks !-OUR LADY FAIR, ARISE ! (20)<br>

O fawn, but yesterday thou said'st, 'At dawn I come<br>
     <dd>   to rouse you up;' but now, all unabashed<br>
Tell us, what quarter didst thou seek ?-is't not yet dawn ?<br>
     <dd>   He Who is sky, and earth, and all things else, to men unknown:<br>
Himself will come, will guard, and make us His; to us<br>
     <dd>   who coming sing His-heavenly cinctur'd Foot, speak thou !<br>
In rapture melt I The King of thee, of us extol;<br>
     <dd>    of all the worlds ! -OUR LADY FAIR, ARISE !  (24)<br>
<br>
VII.<br>
Mother, are these too trifles? Many heavenly ones<br>
     <dd>    know not, the One, the mighty glorious Lord.<br>
Hearing His signals, ope thy mouth, and 'Civan ' cry,<br>
    <dd>  Cry Southern-One.' Like was before the fire<br>
Melting,-'My own, my King, Ambrosia,' we all <br>
     <dd>     have sung! Hear thou ! apart from us yet dost thou sleep ?<br>
Dost thou yet speechless lie, like the hard-hearted silly ones ? <br>

The heav'nly Light without compare, the Grace without compare,- <br>
    <dd>       the Being great without compare, we've sung; hear'st not ?<br>
Bless thee, what slumber's this ? Thou openest not thy mouth ?<br>

The Lady's at His side !-His sacred form dwells not alone !<br>
    <dd>  The VEdam, heavenly ones, and earth, praise Him; and yet<br>
He's our one Friend, Whose praise ne'er dies; within His saints He dwells; <br>
    <dd>   pure He sustains the 'clan '; ye temple-ladies, say<br>
What is His Town ? His Name ? His kin ? and who His foes ? <br>
